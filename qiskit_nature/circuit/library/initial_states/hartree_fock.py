# TODO: There are still some open questions on the exact design/implementation of this class, which
# can only be resolved once we finalize the QubitConverter and implement the Z2 symmetry reduction
# logic into there.
# The reason being, that we would like to be able to use the HF bit-string as an indicator of the Z2
# symmetry sector in which the ground state lies. In the past, this is what hartree_fock_bitstring
# was used for, but as of now, it does not support that.
# If we want to support that, we must be able to use the QubitConverter in such a way that it
# performs the mapping as well as the two_qubit_reduction (if specified) but not the tapering, when
# trying to find the sector of the ground state.
# However, when actually constructing the initial state to be used in a circuit, the symmetry
# reductions need to be applied.
#
# We are leaving the exact implementation of this open for now, because the final API of the
# QubitConverter is not clear yet. As of now, this implementation works as intended for all
# purposes, because Z2 symmetries are not yet supported by the QubitConverter at all, anyways.
