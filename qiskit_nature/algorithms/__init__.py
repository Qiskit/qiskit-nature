Chemistry specific algorithms (:mod:`qiskit_nature.algorithms`)
=======================================================================
These are chemistry specific algorithms. As they rely on chemistry
specific knowledge and/or function they are here in chemistry.

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.algorithms

Chemistry Algorithms
====================
These are algorithms configured and/or functioning using chemistry specific knowledge. See also
:mod:`~qiskit.algorithms` for other algorithms in these categories which may also
be used for chemistry problems such as :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE`.

Eigensolvers
++++++++++++
Algorithms that can find the eigenvalues of an operator, i.e. excited states for chemistry.

**DEPRECATED** See the Excited States Solvers section below

   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   QEomVQE
   QEomEE

Excited State Solvers
+++++++++++++++++++++
Algorithms that can find the eigenvalues of an operator, i.e. excited states for chemistry.

The interface for such solvers,

   ExcitedStatesEigensolver
   QEOM

and factories to provision Quantum and/or Classical algorithms upon which the above solvers may
depend

.. autosummary::

   :nosignatures:

   EigensolverFactory
   NumPyEigensolverFactory

Ground State Solvers
++++++++++++++++++++
Algorithms that can find the minimum eigenvalue of an operator, i.e. ground state for chemistry.

The interface for such solvers,

Potential Energy Surface Samplers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Algorithms that can compute potential energy surfaces.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   BOPESSampler

The samplers include extrapolators to facilitate convergence across a set of points and support
of various potentials. More detail may be found in the sub-module linked below
