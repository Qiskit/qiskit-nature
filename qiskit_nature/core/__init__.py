Chemistry Core (:mod:`qiskit_nature.core`)
=============================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.core

**DEPRECATED** See :mod:`qiskit_nature.transformations` which replace this.

The core was designed to be an extensible system that took a :class:`~qiskit_nature.QMolecule`
and created output which was ready to be input directly to an algorithm
in the form of a qubit operator and list of auxiliary operators such as
dipole moments, spin, number of particles etc.

The one implementation here, :class:`Hamiltonian`, in essence wraps the
:class:`~qiskit_nature.FermionicOperator` to provide easier, convenient access to common
capabilities such that the :class:`~qiskit_nature.FermionicOperator` class need not be
used directly.
